   <h2>Definition</h2>
    <h4>Urban Transformation is a response to redevelopment strategies meeting all requirements for the future. This not only includes the changing of population mobility from one place to another, providing new jobs in a certain area, and improving living quality for the public who lives in the certain region, but also incorporates integrating diverse community's cultural, making a vibrant city with full of life and characters, and improving environment into its future design.</h4>

      <p class="art1">Civic Link is 490m long and 20m wide, connecting from the Parramarra Square to River Square. It will support liveability by creating a 
 pedestrian and a cycle-friendly avenue through Parramatta CBD, fitting for the increased population of Parramatta. It will support sustainability
 by creating a green public space in order to against side effects of climate change, collect stormwater, and satisfy the infrastructure needs.
 It will support productivity by linking the heritages and developing new art and culture precincts. Its linkage provides opportunities to 
 share culture, knowledge, and experiences for creative and active people in Parramatta.
